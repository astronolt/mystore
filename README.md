# Mystore

This project is a simple simulation of a shopping app using Angular CLI. This Single Page Application ( SPA ) adapts well to both mobile and larger screens.

## Usage

My store allows users to add items to their shopping cart from the home page ( Best Selling ) or from the main products page. The shopping cart can be modified by deleting an order or changing the order quantity before checking out and you will be shown a success page after completing the checkout form. Explore. Happy Shopping!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
